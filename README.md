## FAQ
1. **Can I access the contents of a private profile?** No, you cannot get information on private profiles. You can only get information from a public profile or a profile you follow. The tools that claim to be successful are scams!
2. **What is and how I can bypass the `challenge_required` error?** The `challenge_required` error means that Instagram notice a suspicious behavior on your profile, so needs to check if you are a real person or a bot. To avoid this you should follow the suggested link and complete the required operation (insert a code, confirm email, etc)


## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Fork/Clone/Download this repo

    `git clone https://github.com/Datalux/Osintgram.git`

2. Navigate to the directory

    `cd Osintgram`

3. Create a virtual environment for this project

    `python3 -m venv venv`

4. Load the virtual environment
   - On Windows Powershell: `.\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1`
   - On Linux and Git Bash: `source venv/bin/activate`
  
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

6. Open the `credentials.ini` file in the `config` folder and write your Instagram account username and password in the corresponding fields
    
    Alternatively, you can run the `make setup` command to populate this file for you.

7. Run the main.py script in one of two ways

    * As an interactive prompt `python3 main.py <target username>`
    * Or execute your command straight away `python3 main.py <target username> --command <command>`
    
### Use Osintgram v2 (beta)
You can use Osintgram2 beta just switching to `v2` [branch](https://github.com/Datalux/Osintgram/tree/v2).
The v2 has some improvements and is faster with a new command execution interface. Try it just running `git checkout v2`.

## Docker Quick Start üê≥

This section will explain how you can quickly use this image with `Docker` or `Docker-compose`.

### Prerequisites

Before you can use either `Docker` or `Docker-compose`, please ensure you do have the following prerequisites met.

1. **Docker** installed - [link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. **Docker-composed** installed (if using Docker-compose) - [link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
3. **Credentials** configured - This can be done manually or by running the `make setup` command from the root of this repo

**Important**: Your container will fail if you do not do step #3 and configure your credentials

### Docker

If docker is installed you can build an image and run this as a container.

Build:

```bash
docker build -t osintgram .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD/output:/home/osintgram/output" osintgram <target>
```

- The `<target>` is the Instagram account you wish to use as your target for recon.
- The required `-i` flag enables an interactive terminal to use commands within the container. [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#assign-name-and-allocate-pseudo-tty---name--it)
- The required `-v` flag mounts a volume between your local filesystem and the container to save to the `./output/` folder. [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#mount-volume--v---read-only)
- The optional `--rm` flag removes the container filesystem on completion to prevent cruft build-up. [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#clean-up---rm)
- The optional `-t` flag allocates a pseudo-TTY which allows colored output. [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#foreground)

### Using `docker-compose`

You can use the `docker-compose.yml` file this single command:

```bash
docker-compose run osintgram <target>
```

Where `target` is the Instagram target for recon.

Alternatively, you may run `docker-compose` with the `Makefile`:

`make run` - Builds and Runs with compose. Prompts for a `target` before running.

### Makefile (easy mode)

For ease of use with Docker-compose, a `Makefile` has been provided.

Here is a sample work flow to spin up a container and run `osintgram` with just two commands!

1. `make setup`   - Sets up your Instagram credentials
2. `make run`     - Builds and Runs a osintgram container and prompts for a target

Sample workflow for development:

1. `make setup`          - Sets up your Instagram credentials
2. `make build-run-testing`   - Builds an Runs a container without invoking the `main.py` script. Useful for an `it` Docker session for development
3. `make cleanup-testing`     - Cleans up the testing container created from `build-run-testing`

## Development version üíª

To use the development version with the latest feature and fixes just switch to `development` branch using Git:

`git checkout development`

and update to last version using:

`git pull origin development`


## Updating ‚¨áÔ∏è

To update Osintgram with the stable release just pull the latest commit using Git.

1. Make sure you are in the master branch running: `git checkout master`
2. Download the latest version: `git pull origin master`
